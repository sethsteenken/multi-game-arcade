# Home DIY Multi-Game Arcade Machine

## Introduction

This project contains information, resources, and instructions on how to build a DIY, multi-platform, multi-game arcade machine. After having built my own arcade pedestal for my home, I created this repository with the intention of assisting the home arcade community by gathering all the necessary resources and providing comprehensive guidance to those looking to embark on the exciting journey of building their first custom arcade machine.

The arcade pedestal is powered by a Windows PC running [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/), [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and is presented and orchestrated using [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/). The cabinet hardware is made from pre-cut 3/4" MDF, printed with custom artwork design, and was provided as DIY kit from [GameRoomSolutions](https://www.gameroomsolutions.com/). The control panel features a 4 joysticks, 8 buttons for 1-2 players, 4 buttons for 3-4 players, 4 sets of start and coin buttons, admin buttons, flight stick, and a trackball. The pedestal is complemented by a 43" 4K LED TV, LED lighting, and 2 light guns.

*The final result, ready for endless gaming! Overwatch is one of my favorite games of all time, so it was fitting as a theme for the arcade.*
